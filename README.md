# Ecommerce UI Clone

## Description

This was my very first project, where I focused on replicating the famous Ecommerce UI. At that time, I didn’t know much about responsive design, so I used `px` (pixels) everywhere. The goal was to practice structuring a complex layout and get a real feel of building a web page from scratch.

## What I added in this Clone

-   Replicated the famous Ecommerce UI using browser inspect tools.
-   Used semantic section tags like `header`, `main`, and `footer` to structure the page properly.
-   Organized the layout carefully so that revisiting the code later would be easier.
-   Kept the code clean and readable, focusing on good structure and maintainability.

## What I Learned

-   Successfully replicating my first project gave me a strong sense of accomplishment.
-   Understood the importance of responsive design, even though this project isn’t fully responsive.
-   Practiced Flexbox extensively and learned its quirks through trial and error.
-   Learned to wrap content inside a main wrapper div for better structure.
-   Realized the value of inspecting websites before building — it helped me understand layout, spacing, and component hierarchy.
-   Learned to avoid repeating mistakes from this project in future projects, such as overusing fixed `px` values.
