# Challenges I Faced

-   At first, I followed tutorials, but I noticed their UI clones lacked proper spacing. By inspecting the real famous Ecommers site, I realized that to get proper spacing, everything needs to be divided into clear sections and boxes.

-   I used margin everywhere in the beginning, but later learned that relying too much on horizontal margins can break layouts when making them responsive.

-   When I added hover effects, the elements started flickering.  
    I figured out it was because of `box-sizing: border-box`. The solution was to set a transparent border first, which fixed the issue.

-   Positioning content above a background image was difficult.  
    I had to check multiple tutorials before I managed it. I still don’t fully grasp it, but I know I’ll improve with practice.

-   Arranging content cards was a challenge.
    I learned `flex-wrap`, but also realized that for such layouts, `grid` might be a better choice.  
    Big lesson: **Combining Flexbox and Grid is crucial.**

-   After completing the project, I discovered the importance of responsive design.  
    At that time, it was too confusing, so I skipped it for this project but promised myself to make the next one responsive, no matter how much time it took.

-   When reducing screen size, my site kept breaking.  
    I learned that using `px` everywhere (font, size, margin, padding) is bad practice, and I should use relative units instead.

-   Media queries looked impossible at first, but in my next project I took every mistake I made here and fixed them to build a proper responsive design.

-   My **Salesforce clone** became my 2nd best project because I applied both Flexbox and Grid together.  
    My best one so far is the **Netflix UI clone**.

# Final Note

I tried to explain the real challenges I faced in this first project.  
If you check my later work, you’ll see how I improved from this messy design to more polished and responsive clones.
